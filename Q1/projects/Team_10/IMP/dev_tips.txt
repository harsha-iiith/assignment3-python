[IMP] Key Points to Remember

- One branch per issue/ticket.
- Meaningful commit messages with the issue number and a closing keyword.
- Always pull master before starting a new branch to avoid merge conflicts.
- Use GitHub Issues & Projects to track work, not ad-hoc messages.
- Following these steps keeps history clean, issues auto-closed, and everyone in sync.
