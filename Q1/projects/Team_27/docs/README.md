# VidyaVichar - Mermaid Diagrams

This directory contains Mermaid diagram files for the VidyaVichar Q&A system architecture and design documentation.

## Available Diagrams

### 1. High-Level Architecture (`high-level-architecture.mmd`)
**Purpose**: Shows the overall system architecture with three-tier design
**Components**: Client Tier (React Frontend), Application Tier (Express Backend), Data Tier (MongoDB)
**Usage**: Understanding system overview and component relationships

### 2. Low-Level Design (`low-level-design.mmd`) 
**Purpose**: Detailed component interactions and data flow
**Components**: Frontend modules, Backend services, Database schemas
**Usage**: Understanding internal component architecture and dependencies

### 3. Data Flow Sequence (`data-flow-sequence.mmd`)
**Purpose**: Sequential interaction flows between system components
**Scenarios**: Authentication, Session creation, Question posting, Real-time updates, Session end
**Usage**: Understanding step-by-step user interactions and system responses

### 4. Database Schema (`database-schema.mmd`)
**Purpose**: Entity-Relationship diagram for MongoDB collections
**Components**: Participants, Sessions, SessionUpdates, Questions, Replies
**Usage**: Understanding data model relationships and constraints

### 5. User Flow (`user-flow.mmd`)
**Purpose**: Complete user journey through the application
**Flows**: Login process, Role-based dashboards, Session interactions, Real-time features
**Usage**: Understanding user experience and application navigation

### 6. System Architecture (`system-architecture.mmd`)
**Purpose**: Detailed backend system layers and dependencies
**Layers**: API Gateway, Controller, Service, Socket, Data Access, Database
**Usage**: Understanding backend architecture patterns and separation of concerns
